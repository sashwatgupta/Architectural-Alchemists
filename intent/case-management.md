## Overview
The Case Management System is designed to efficiently handle and process cases within an organization. This serverless architecture leverages AWS Fargate for containerized workloads and AWS Step Functions for orchestrating the case workflow.

## Components

### 1. AWS Fargate for Microservices:
Deploy microservices in containerized form using AWS Fargate. Each microservice encapsulates specific functionalities within the Case Management System.

   - **Case Creation Service:** Handles the creation of new cases, assigning unique case identifiers and initial case details.
   
   - **Case Processing Service:** Manages the progression of cases through various stages, assigning tasks to appropriate personnel.

   - **Document Management Service:** Enables the attachment, retrieval, and management of documents related to each case.

### 2. Amazon S3 for Document Storage:

- Store documents related to cases, such as evidentiary materials, reports, and multimedia files. Leverage versioning for document management.

### 3. AWS Step Functions for Workflow Orchestration:

Utilize AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the case workflow across microservices. Define state machines to guide the flow of activities, including:

   - **Case Initiation:** Trigger the workflow when a new case is created.

   - **Task Assignment:** Assign tasks to relevant personnel based on case details.

   - **Document Handling:** Manage the attachment and retrieval of documents using the Document Management Service.

   - **Approval:** Incorporate approval processes within the workflow when necessary.

   - **Compensation:** Initiates compensation management if required.

   - **Completion:** Finalize and close the case after all required tasks are completed.

### 4. Amazon DynamoDB for State Management:

Store and manage the state of case workflows in Amazon DynamoDB. This ensures the system can recover and resume workflows at the correct state in case of failures.

### 5. AWS Lambda for Serverless Compute:

Deploy serverless functions for specific tasks within the case workflow.

   - **Event Trigger Lambda:** Listens for events (e.g., new case creation) and initiates the case workflow by starting the Step Functions execution.

   - **Task Assignment Lambda:** Dynamically assigns tasks to relevant personnel based on case details.

   - **Document Management Lambda:** Handles document-related operations, such as attachment and retrieval.

### 6. AWS Cloudfront
Securely deliver content with low latency and high transfer speeds.

### 7. ElastiCache
ElastiCache (e.g., Redis) will be used for caching frequently accessed data, enhancing the performance of case-related operations.

### 8. Load Balancer
An Application Load Balancer will distribute incoming traffic across multiple Fargate containers, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization.

### 9. API Gateway
API Gateway will be used to create, publish, and manage APIs securely, facilitating communication between client applications and backend services.

### 10. Amazon Cognito
Cognito will be employed for secure user authentication and authorization, managing access to case-related functionalities based on user roles.

### 11. Data Mesh
Integrates with multiple systems to get the latest customer information with the data identified through the data catalog in data mesh.

### 12. Data Product
A data product is created and shared with relevant information. [Reference Architecture](/intent/reference-architecture.md#reference-architecture-for-a-data-product)

## Security Considerations

1. **IAM Roles and Policies:** Define IAM roles with the principle of least privilege for microservices, Step Functions, and Lambda functions.

2. **Encryption:** Enable encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive case details and documents.

3. **Access Controls:** Implement proper access controls on S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, and other resources to restrict unauthorized access.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms:** Monitor and set up alarms for key metrics such as Step Functions execution times, Fargate task failures, and Lambda invocations.

2. **CloudTrail:** Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing and logging AWS API calls for compliance and security purposes.

3. **Logging Services:** Utilize CloudWatch Logs and centralized logging solutions to aggregate and analyze logs from microservices and Lambda functions.

## Scalability and Cost Optimization

1. **Auto Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling for Fargate tasks and Lambda functions to handle varying workloads efficiently.

2. **Pay-as-You-Go Model:** Leverage the serverless nature of Fargate and Lambda, ensuring costs are directly proportional to actual usage.

## Conclusion
This serverless architecture for the Case Management System leverages AWS Fargate for containerized microservices and AWS Step Functions for orchestrating workflows. It provides a scalable, cost-efficient, and resilient solution for efficiently managing cases within the organization.
