## Architecture Overview
1. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):**
   - Use Amazon Aurora to store employee and compensation-related data.

2. **AWS Lambda:**
   - Implement AWS Lambda functions to handle various compensation-related processes, such as calculation, validation, and notifications.
   - Create functions for processing events triggered by changes in flight, schedules or issues raised by passengers.

3. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
   - Use Amazon S3 to store documents related to compensation
   - Implement versioning for documents and set appropriate access controls.
   - Use s3 to store assets to be served to the user interface

4. **Amazon API Gateway:**
   - Create RESTful APIs using Amazon API Gateway to expose compensation-related services.
   - Secure APIs with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and OAuth for authentication and authorization.

4. **Customer 360 View:**
Integrate with Customer 360 view to get the users information.

4. **Notification System:**
Integrate with Notification system to send notifications to users

5. **AWS Step Functions:**
   - Use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple Lambda functions.
   - Design workflows for compensation approval processes
   
6. **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
   - Implement IAM roles and policies to manage access to AWS resources.
   - Define roles for different user types such as passengers, managers, and employees.

7. **Amazon Cognito:**
   - Utilize Amazon Cognito for user authentication and federation.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

8. **Amazon CloudWatch:**
   - Implement CloudWatch for monitoring Lambda functions, API Gateway, and database performance.
   - Set up alarms for critical events or performance thresholds.

9. **AWS CloudTrail:**
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing API calls and changes to AWS resources.
   - Retain CloudTrail logs for compliance and auditing purposes.

10. **Amazon CloudFront:**
    - Use Amazon CloudFront for content delivery, especially for serving static assets and documents.
    - Implement caching strategies to improve latency.

11. **Elasticache:**
    - Consider using Elasticache for storing temporary or frequently accessed data.

12. **Lake formation:**
    - Use lakeformation to get access to the PII information as well as credit card from the relevant domain system (booking, loyalty).

## Security Considerations

1. Implement encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data.
2. Regularly rotate access keys, secrets, and database credentials.
3. Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring IAM roles and policies.
4. Regularly scan for security vulnerabilities in the application code and dependencies.
5. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Scalability Considerations

1. Design the system to scale horizontally to handle a growing number of users and compensation-related data.
2. Leverage AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust resources based on demand.
3. Consider using Amazon Aurora Serverless for automatic and cost-effective database scaling.

## Compliance Considerations

1. Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
2. Implement proper data retention policies and mechanisms.
