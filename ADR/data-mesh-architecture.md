# Selection of Data Mesh Architecture

**Date**: 04/12/2023

**Status** : Accepted

## Context
In the ever-evolving landscape of data management, our organization is faced with the challenge of scaling and decentralizing our data infrastructure. The traditional monolithic data architecture has become a bottleneck, impeding agility, scalability, and the ability to innovate. After thorough research and evaluation of various data architectures, we have decided to adopt the Data Mesh architecture to address these challenges.

## Decision
We choose to implement the Data Mesh architecture to manage our organization's data ecosystem.


## Decision Drivers
### Scalability
Data Mesh architecture promotes scalability by distributing data ownership and processing across decentralized domains. This allows us to scale individual data domains independently, enhancing overall system scalability.

### Agility
The Data Mesh approach aligns with our organization's need for greater agility. It enables cross-functional, autonomous teams to take ownership of their data domains, making it easier to adapt to changing business requirements.

### Data Ownership and Autonomy
Data Mesh emphasizes the concept of domain-oriented decentralized data ownership. This ensures that each business domain is responsible for its own data, fostering a culture of autonomy and accountability.

### Reduced Centralization
Traditional monolithic data architectures often lead to centralization, creating bottlenecks and inhibiting innovation. Data Mesh, with its decentralized approach, mitigates these issues, allowing for more efficient data management.

### Technology Agnosticism
Data Mesh is technology-agnostic, allowing us to leverage a diverse set of tools and technologies that best fit the requirements of individual data domains. This flexibility aligns with our organization's preference for using the right tools for the right job.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration
Data Mesh encourages collaboration between different functional areas, breaking down silos that hinder innovation. This fosters a culture of collaboration, where data is seen as a shared asset that benefits the entire organization.

## Consequences
### Learning Curve
Transitioning to a Data Mesh architecture may require training and upskilling of existing teams to align with the decentralized and domain-oriented principles.

### Initial Implementation Effort
There will be an upfront effort required to establish the foundational elements of the Data Mesh architecture, including domain identification, team setup, and defining data products.

### Cultural Shift
Adopting Data Mesh necessitates a cultural shift towards embracing autonomy and accountability in managing data. This shift may require time and effort to be fully realized.

## Considered Alternatives
### Traditional Monolithic Data Architecture
 Maintaining the status quo with a monolithic data architecture was considered, but it was deemed inadequate to meet our scalability and agility requirements.

### Data Lake or Data Warehouse
While these options are suitable for centralized storage and processing, they lack the flexibility and autonomy offered by a Data Mesh architecture.

### Federated Data Model
Federated data models were considered, but they often present challenges related to consistency, governance, and centralized control.

## Decision Evaluation
The decision to adopt the Data Mesh architecture was made after careful consideration of its alignment with our organization's scalability, agility, and autonomy goals. The benefits of decentralization, cross-functional collaboration, and technology agnosticism provided compelling reasons to choose Data Mesh over alternative architectures.
