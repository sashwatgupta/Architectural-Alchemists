## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Graph Database Model:** AWS Neptune, being a graph database, is well-suited for representing and querying interconnected data, making it an ideal choice for managing relationships and connections within customer data.

2. **Scalability:** Neptune supports horizontal scaling, allowing us to handle growing volumes of customer data and queries as the customer base expands.

3. **Flexible Data Model:** The graph data model of Neptune accommodates diverse and evolving data structures, providing flexibility to capture various attributes and relationships within the customer data.

4. **Query Performance:** Neptune's optimized graph query engine enhances the performance of complex queries, facilitating efficient retrieval of interconnected customer information.

5. **Managed Service:** Neptune is a fully managed service in AWS, reducing operational overhead related to database administration, backups, and maintenance.

### Negative

1. **Learning Curve:** Adopting a graph database may introduce a learning curve for development and operations teams, especially if they are not familiar with graph database concepts.

2. **Cost Consideration:** While Neptune provides scalability, it's essential to monitor and optimize costs, especially as the volume of customer data and query complexity increase.

## Options Considered

1. **Relational Databases:** Traditional relational databases were considered but might be less suitable for managing highly interconnected customer data efficiently.

2. **Document Stores:** Document-oriented databases were evaluated, but their data model may not capture relationships between customer entities as effectively as a graph database.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Interconnected Data:** The Customer 360 view involves complex relationships and dependencies among various customer entities, making a graph database a natural fit.

2. **Scalability Requirements:** Neptune's ability to scale horizontally aligns with the anticipated growth in customer data and the need for efficient query performance.

3. **AWS Ecosystem Integration:** Neptune seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, facilitating data exchange and analytics integration within the broader AWS ecosystem.
