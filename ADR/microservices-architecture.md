# Selection of Microservice Architecture

**Date**: 04/12/2023

**Status** : Accepted

## Context
 After thorough evaluation of architectural options, we have decided to adopt a Microservice Architecture to meet the evolving needs of our business.

## Decision
We choose to implement a Microservice Architecture for the design and development of our system.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scalability:** Microservices provide the ability to scale individual components independently, allowing us to scale specific services based on demand and optimize resource utilization.
- **Agility:** Microservices promote agility by allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of services. This supports faster release cycles and enables teams to work autonomously.
- **Technology Diversity:** Microservices enable the use of diverse technologies and frameworks for different services, allowing us to choose the best tools for specific business requirements and avoid technology lock-in.
- **Fault Isolation:** Microservices provide isolation between services, minimizing the impact of failures in one service on the overall system. This enhances fault tolerance and system resilience.
- **Team Autonomy:** Microservices align with our organizational structure, empowering cross-functional teams to take ownership of specific services and make independent decisions, fostering a culture of autonomy and accountability.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Microservices facilitate continuous delivery practices, enabling smaller, more frequent releases. This supports faster time-to-market and allows for rapid adaptation to changing business needs.
- **Scalable Development:** Microservices enable a modular and scalable development approach, allowing teams to work on and deploy individual services without affecting the entire system.

## Consequences
- **Increased Complexity:** Managing a distributed system introduces complexity in terms of communication, data consistency, and monitoring. Proper tooling and practices will be required to address this complexity.
- **Operational Overhead:** Operating and monitoring a microservices architecture requires robust DevOps practices and tooling to ensure effective management of the distributed system.
- **Service Discovery and Orchestration:** Implementing service discovery and orchestration mechanisms will be necessary to manage communication between microservices effectively.
- **Data Management Challenges:** Handling data consistency, transactions, and communication between microservices may introduce challenges that require careful consideration and design.
- **Team Coordination:** Effective communication and coordination between teams are crucial to avoid issues related to inconsistent APIs, dependencies, and overall system coherence.

## Considered Alternatives
- **Monolithic Architecture:** Maintaining the existing monolithic architecture was considered, but it was deemed insufficient to meet scalability and agility requirements.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** SOA was considered, but Microservices were chosen for their finer granularity, independent deployment, and scalability advantages.

## Decision Evaluation
The decision to adopt a Microservice Architecture was made after careful consideration of its alignment with the organization's goals for scalability, agility, and team autonomy. The benefits of modular development, scalability, and technology diversity provided compelling reasons to choose Microservices over alternative architectures.
