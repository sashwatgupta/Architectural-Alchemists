# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - Social Media Consumption using AWS Lambda

## Context

The need to efficiently consume and process social media data for various applications, such as sentiment analysis, content moderation, and trend analysis, has prompted the exploration of serverless architecture options. AWS Lambda is chosen as the preferred solution for its event-driven model and seamless integration with other AWS services.

## Decision

We will implement social media data consumption using AWS Lambda.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Event-Driven Model:** Lambda's event-driven architecture allows us to consume social media data in real-time, ensuring timely processing and analysis.

2. **Serverless Scaling:** Lambda scales automatically based on the number of incoming events, providing optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency.

3. **Cost-Efficiency:** With Lambda, we pay only for the compute time consumed during the execution of functions, resulting in potential cost savings compared to maintaining continuously running servers.

4. **Integration with AWS Ecosystem:** Lambda seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, allowing us to easily connect social media data processing with services like S3, DynamoDB, and comprehend for sentiment analysis.

### Negative

1. **Cold Start Latency:** Cold starts may introduce a slight delay in processing events, particularly if the Lambda function has been idle and needs to be initialized.

2. **Execution Time Limit:** Lambda functions have a maximum execution time limit, which may impact the processing of large volumes of social media data within a single function execution.

## Options Considered

1. **AWS Fargate:** While Fargate provides more control over the environment, Lambda's event-driven nature aligns better with the sporadic and bursty nature of social media data.

2. **EC2 Instances:** Traditional EC2 instances would require manual scaling and maintenance, introducing higher operational overhead.

3. **Third Party:** Third party services provide the options to stream social media data. This option needs considerable evaluation of various vendors and does not seem to be efficient. 

## Decision Drivers

1. **Event-Driven Requirement:** Social media data consumption is inherently event-driven, making Lambda a suitable choice for processing individual events as they occur.

2. **Cost Efficiency:** Lambda's pay-as-you-go pricing model aligns well with the variable nature of social media data processing.

3. **Integration Possibilities:** Lambda seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, facilitating easy integration with downstream applications and analytics tools.
