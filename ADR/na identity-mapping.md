One of the main concerns in a distributed domain data architecture, is the ability to correlate data across domains and stitch them together in wonderful, insightful ways; join, filter, aggregate, etc. The key for an effective correlation of data across domains is following certain standards and harmonization rules. Such standardizations should belong to a global governance, to enable interoperability between polyglot domain datasets. Common concerns of such standardization efforts are field type formatting, identifying polysemes across different domains, datasets address conventions, common metadata fields, event formats such as CloudEvents, etc.
