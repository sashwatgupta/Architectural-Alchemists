# Adoption of Cloud-Native Architecture

**Date**: 04/12/2023

**Status** : Accepted

## Context
As the organization embarks on a digital transformation journey to modernize its infrastructure and applications, a decision is needed to define the architectural approach. After thorough evaluation of available options, the organization has chosen to adopt a Cloud-Native Architecture to leverage cloud services and align with contemporary best practices.

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

## Decision
We choose to implement a Cloud-Native Architecture for the design and development of our system.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scalability:** Cloud-Native Architecture supports horizontal scaling, allowing the system to efficiently handle varying workloads and accommodate growth.

- **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:** Leveraging cloud services enables the implementation of distributed, fault-tolerant systems that can recover from failures and ensure high availability.

- **Flexibility and Agility:** Cloud-Native principles, such as microservices and containerization, promote agility in development, deployment, and scaling, fostering a faster time-to-market.

- **Cost Optimization:** Cloud-Native Architecture allows for efficient resource utilization, dynamic scaling, and a pay-as-you-go model, contributing to cost optimization.

- **DevOps Practices:** Cloud-Native aligns with DevOps principles, promoting collaboration between development and operations teams to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery.

- **Containerization and Orchestration:** Utilizing containers and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) facilitates consistent deployment and management of applications across different environments.

- **Automation:** Cloud-Native Architecture promotes automation of processes, reducing manual intervention and enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

## Consequences
- **Learning Curve:** Teams may require training and upskilling to adapt to the cloud-native paradigm and associated tools.

- **Vendor Lock-in:** Depending on specific cloud services chosen, there may be considerations regarding vendor lock-in. Efforts should be made to mitigate this risk through the use of open standards and abstraction layers.

- **Operational Complexity:** Implementing a cloud-native architecture introduces complexities related to distributed systems, container orchestration, and service discovery.

- **Security Considerations:** Proper security practices must be implemented to protect cloud-native applications and data. This includes identity and access management, encryption, and network security.

## Considered Alternatives
- **Traditional On-Premises Deployment:** Maintaining the existing on-premises infrastructure was considered, but it did not provide the scalability and agility required.

- **Hybrid Cloud Approach:** A hybrid cloud model was considered, but a fully cloud-native approach was chosen for its alignment with scalability and modern development practices.

## Decision Evaluation
The decision to adopt a Cloud-Native Architecture was made based on its strong alignment with the organization's goals for scalability, resilience, flexibility, and cost optimization. The benefits of embracing cloud-native principles and leveraging cloud services provided a compelling case for this architectural choice.
