<!-- /TOC -->

## Context
The organization requires a workflow orchestration solution to manage and coordinate tasks across various services and components within the AWS ecosystem. The decision is to choose a suitable technology to implement the workflow and human approval, and AWS Step Functions is being considered.

## Decision
We will use AWS Step Functions as the workflow orchestration solution for managing and coordinating tasks within our system.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Service Integration:** AWS Step Functions seamlessly integrates with various AWS services, making it easy to coordinate workflows across Lambda functions, API Gateway, and other AWS resources.

2. **Visual Workflow Editor:** Step Functions provides a visual workflow editor, enabling easy design, visualization, and modification of workflows without the need for complex coding.

3. **Retry and Error Handling:** Step Functions offers built-in support for retrying failed steps and handling errors, improving the resilience of workflows.

4. **State Management:** Step Functions automatically manages the state of workflows, allowing us to easily track progress and handle long-running processes.

5. **Cost Optimization:** Step Functions follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, and we only pay for the state transitions and steps executed during workflow execution.

### Negative

1. **Learning Curve:** Teams may need to familiarize themselves with the Step Functions state machine language and concepts, especially if they are new to workflow orchestration.

2. **Limited Customization:** While Step Functions provides a rich set of features, there might be cases where highly customized workflow logic requires additional coding within Lambda functions.

## Options Considered

1. **AWS Step Functions:** A fully managed service provided by AWS for workflow orchestration.

2. **Apache Airflow:** An open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

3. **AWS SWF (Simple Workflow Service):** An older AWS service for building scalable and resilient applications.

## Decision Drivers

1. **AWS Native Integration:** The seamless integration with other AWS services makes Step Functions a natural choice for managing workflows within the AWS ecosystem.

2. **Ease of Use:** The visual workflow editor and built-in features simplify the design and management of workflows.

3. **Scalability:** Step Functions can scale with the growth of our application and handle complex workflows efficiently.
