# Adoption of Event-Driven Architecture

**Date**: 04/12/2023

**Status** : Accepted

## Context
 After careful evaluation, it has been decided to adopt an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) to support asynchronous communication and decouple components within our system.

## Decision
We choose to implement an Event-Driven Architecture for the design and development of our system.


## Decision Drivers
- **Scalability:** Event-Driven Architecture enables horizontal scalability by allowing components to communicate asynchronously, reducing dependencies and bottlenecks.

- **Real-Time Responsiveness:** EDA supports real-time data processing and responsiveness by enabling immediate reactions to events, facilitating quicker decision-making.

- **Loose Coupling:** Events act as messages that decouple components, promoting a loosely coupled system where changes in one part of the system do not directly impact others.

- **Flexibility and Extensibility:** EDA accommodates flexibility in system design, making it easier to add or modify components without disrupting the entire system.

- **Fault Isolation:** Event-Driven Architecture enhances fault isolation, as failures in one component do not necessarily affect others, contributing to system resilience.

- **Event Sourcing and Stateful Processing:** By leveraging event sourcing and stateful processing, we can capture and store the history of events, supporting auditability and reconstructing system state.

# Consequences
- **Learning Curve:** Teams may need to acquire new skills and understanding of event-driven paradigms and related technologies.

- **Operational Complexity:** Implementing event-driven systems introduces complexities related to event sourcing, distributed event processing, and managing eventual consistency.

- **Debugging Challenges:** Debugging and tracing events across distributed systems may be more challenging compared to traditional synchronous architectures.

- **Event Schema Evolution:** Managing changes to event schemas requires careful consideration to maintain backward compatibility and avoid breaking existing consumers.

# Considered Alternatives
- **Request-Response Architecture:** A traditional request-response architecture was considered, but it was deemed less suitable for achieving the desired scalability, real-time responsiveness, and loose coupling.

- **Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM):** MOM was considered, but Event-Driven Architecture was chosen for its alignment with modern microservices and distributed system patterns.

## Decision Evaluation
The decision to adopt an Event-Driven Architecture was made based on its strong alignment with the organization's goals for scalability, responsiveness, and flexibility. The benefits of loose coupling, fault isolation, and real-time processing provided compelling reasons to choose EDA over alternative architectures.
