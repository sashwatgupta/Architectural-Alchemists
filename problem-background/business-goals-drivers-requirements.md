In response to identified challenges and opportunities within the airline's customer service ecosystem, there is a strategic imperative to develop a cutting-edge Customer Management Platform (CMP). This innovative platform aims to revolutionize customer interactions across the entire travel journey, from ticket booking to in-flight experiences and beyond. Focused on elevating customer satisfaction and retention rates while driving increased revenue, the CMP unifies and leverages data from diverse touchpoints, enabling personalized services and proactive issue resolution. With a commitment to providing a 360-degree view of each passenger, this initiative aligns with the airline's vision to be a customer-centric organization, fostering stronger connections with passengers and optimizing operational efficiency.
