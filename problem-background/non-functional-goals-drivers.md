# Non-functional Architectural Drivers

1. **Performance:**
   - *Response Time:* Define the maximum acceptable response time for different system functions.
   - *Throughput:* Specify the number of transactions or operations the system should handle per unit of time.

2. **Scalability:**
   - *Horizontal Scaling:* Design the system to easily scale by adding more instances or nodes.
   - *Vertical Scaling:* Design the system to handle increased load on a single node through hardware upgrades.

3. **Reliability:**
   - *Fault Tolerance:* Ensure the system continues to operate properly in the presence of hardware or software failures.
   - *High Availability:* Minimize downtime by providing redundant components and failover mechanisms.

4. **Availability:**
   - *System Uptime:* Define the required percentage of time the system should be available.
   - *Redundancy:* Introduce redundancy at various levels to ensure continuous service availability.

5. **Security:**
   - *Data Encryption:* Implement mechanisms to encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
   - *Authentication and Authorization:* Define secure access controls and user authentication methods.

6. **Maintainability:**
   - *Modularity:* Design the system with modular components to facilitate easier maintenance and updates.
   - *Documentation:* Provide comprehensive documentation for system components, APIs, and configurations.

7. **Flexibility and Extensibility:**
   - *Plugin Architecture:* Design the system to allow easy integration of plugins or extensions.
   - *APIs:* Provide well-defined and documented APIs to enable integration with external systems.

8. **Usability:**
   - *User Interface Design:* Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
   - *Accessibility:* Ensure the system is accessible to users with disabilities.

9. **Compliance:**
   - *Regulatory Compliance:* Adhere to industry-specific regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and standards.
   - *Legal Compliance:* Ensure the system complies with relevant laws and legal requirements.

10. **Performance Efficiency:**
    - *Resource Utilization:* Optimize resource usage to ensure efficient performance.
    - *Load Balancing:* Implement mechanisms to distribute workloads evenly across system components.

11. **Interoperability:**
    - *Standard Protocols:* Use standard communication protocols to enable interoperability with other systems.
    - *Integration Points:* Identify and define clear interfaces for integration with external systems.

12. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - *Logging:* Implement detailed logging for debugging and auditing purposes.
    - *Monitoring:* Set up monitoring tools to track system performance and detect issues proactively.

13. **Data Management:**
    - *Data Storage:* Choose appropriate data storage solutions based on data volume, type, and access patterns.
    - *Data Privacy:* Implement measures to protect user data and ensure privacy compliance.

14. **Cost:**
    - *Resource Optimization:* Optimize resource usage to minimize operational costs.
    - *Scalability Costs:* Evaluate and manage costs associated with scaling the system.
